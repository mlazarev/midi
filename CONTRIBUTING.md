### üìù Documentation Improvements

Documentation contributions are highly valued:

- Fix typos or clarify explanations
- Add examples or diagrams
- Improve tutorials and guides
- Translate to other languages
- Add missing technical details

### üîß Adding New Implementations

Want to add support for another synthesizer? Great!

1. Create directory: `implementations/<manufacturer>/<model>/`
2. Follow the MS2000 structure as a template
3. Include:
   - README.md with device info and usage
   - Decoder tool(s)
   - Example SysEx files (with proper licensing)
   - Documentation of SysEx format
   - MIDI implementation chart (if available)

### üß™ Code Contributions

Code contributions should:

- Solve a specific problem or add a clear feature
- Follow the existing code style
- Include docstrings and comments
- Work with Python 3.7+
- Not require external dependencies (if possible)

## Development Setup

   python3 decode_sysex.py ../patches/factory/FactoryBanks.syx
   ```

6. **Commit your changes**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add feature: description of your changes"
   ```

7. **Push to your fork**
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

8. **Create Pull Request**
   - Go to your fork on GitHub
   - Click "Pull Request"
   - Describe your changes

## Style Guidelines

### Python Code

Follow PEP 8 with these specifics:

```python
# Imports
import sys
from pathlib import Path

# Constants
MANUFACTURER_ID = 0x42
DEVICE_ID = 0x58

# Functions - clear docstrings
def decode_sysex(data):
    """
    Decode SysEx data using 7-to-8 bit algorithm.

    Args:
        data: bytes object containing encoded data

    Returns:
        bytes object containing decoded data
    """
    # Implementation with comments explaining complex logic
    pass

# Classes - clear structure
class Patch:
    """Represents a synthesizer patch."""

    def __init__(self, data):
        """Initialize patch from raw data."""
        self.data = data
        self.parse()
```

### Documentation

- Use **Markdown** for all documentation
- Include **code examples** where helpful
- Add **diagrams** for complex concepts (ASCII art is fine)
- **Link** between related documents
- Keep **line length** under 100 characters for readability

### Commit Messages

Use clear, descriptive commit messages:

```
Add MS2000 parameter decoder for oscillator section

- Decode OSC1 and OSC2 waveform settings
- Extract pitch and modulation parameters
- Add constants for waveform types
- Update documentation with oscillator byte map
```

Format:
- First line: Brief summary (50 chars or less)
- Blank line
- Detailed description (wrapped at 72 chars)
